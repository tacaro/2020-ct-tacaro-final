# 3D points and lines
```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits import mplot3d
```

Let's first recall how to initialize a plot in Python:
```{python}
fig = plt.figure()
ax = plt.axes(projection='3d')
fig
```


The simplest 3d plot is a line or scatter plot created from sets of xyz triplets. These can be created using the `ax.plot3D` or `ax.scatter3D` functions. Here we'll plot a spiral along with points randomly drawn near the line:

```{python}
ax = plt.axes(projection='3d') # initialize the plot

# Data for a three-dimensional line
zline = np.linspace(0, 15, 1000)
xline = np.sin(zline)
yline = np.cos(zline)
ax.plot3D(xline, yline, zline, 'red')


```

```{python}
# Data for three-dimensional scattered points
ax = plt.axes(projection='3d')
zdata = 15 * np.random.random(100)
xdata = np.sin(zdata) + 0.1 * np.random.randn(100)
ydata = np.cos(zdata) + 0.1 * np.random.randn(100)
ax.scatter3D(xdata, ydata, zdata, c=zdata, cmap='Greens')

```

# Wireframes and Surface Plots

Two other types of three-dimensional plots that work on gridded data are wireframes and surface plots. These take a grid of values and project it onto the specified three-dimensional surface, and can make the resulting three-dimensional forms quite easy to visualize. Here's an example of using a wireframe:

```{python}
def f(x, y):
    return np.sin(np.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2))

x = np.linspace(-6, 6, 30)
y = np.linspace(-6, 6, 30)

X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
Z = f(X, Y)

fig = plt.figure()
ax = plt.axes(projection='3d')
ax.plot_wireframe(X, Y, Z, color='black')
ax.view_init(60, 35)
ax.set_title('wireframe');
fig
```

And a surface plot: 
```{python}
ax = plt.axes(projection='3d')
ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, rstride=1, cstride=1,
                cmap='viridis', edgecolor='none')
ax.set_title('surface');
ax
```
